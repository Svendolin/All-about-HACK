_**WIRESHARK:**_

Wireshark is a free software for analysis and graphical processing of data protocols, which was created in 2006 as a fork of the program Ethereal. Such data protocols are used by computers on various communication media such as the local network, Bluetooth or USB. Wireshark is a packet sniffer and analysis tool. It captures network traffic on the local network and stores this data for offline analysis.
